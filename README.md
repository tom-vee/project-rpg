<b>NOTE: PROJECT STILL IN DEVELOPMENT</b><br>
Project RPG is a game that I created after learning about programming through Javascript. It's built with vanilla Javascript, HTML and CSS.


# Ideas
- Boss stats: attack 5, health 20, weapon damage 2
- Each boss kill gains 2 XP

- Attributes: Attack, Health, XP, Level
  
| XP | Level    | Kills Required    |Attack    |Health    |
| :---:   | :---: | :---: | :---: |:---: |
| 0 | 0 | 0 |10 |10 |
| 4 | 1 | 2 |12 |11 |
| 12 | 2 | 6 |14 |12 |
| 36 | 3 | 18 |16 |13 |
| 108 | 4 | 54 |18 |14 |
| 324 | 5 | 162 |20 |15 |

# Mechanics
- Hit: attack / weapon damage

- Percentage to hit: (hit * attack)/100
